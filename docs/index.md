## Quick Start

Install the package:

```bash
npm install stellar-hooks
```

Wrap your app with the provider:

```tsx
import { StellarProvider } from "stellar-hooks";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <StellarProvider network="testnet">
    <App />
  </StellarProvider>
);
```

Use hooks in your components:

```tsx
import { useFreighter, useStellarBalance } from "stellar-hooks";

export function App() {
  const { isConnected, publicKey, connect } = useFreighter();
  const { xlmBalance } = useStellarBalance(publicKey);

  if (!isConnected) {
    return <button onClick={connect}>Connect Freighter</button>;
  }

  return (
    <p>
      {publicKey} · {xlmBalance?.balance ?? "..."} XLM
    </p>
  );
}
```
